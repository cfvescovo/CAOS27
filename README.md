## Part 1: Qemu emulation

QEMU is a powerful and open source emulator and virtualizer designed to meet a wide range of use cases. By leveraging dynamic translation, it delivers high performance and flexibility for emulating complete systems or specific userspace environments. The target board is the NXP S32K3X8EVB, that was not supported on QEMU.

### Full Machine Emulation
QEMU can emulate an entire machine in software without requiring hardware virtualization support. This enables running operating systems and applications designed for one hardware architecture (e.g., ARMv7) on a completely different architecture. When integrated with Xen or KVM hypervisors, QEMU achieves near-native performance for CPUs, as the hypervisor manages the CPU while QEMU handles emulated hardware.

### Userspace API Virtualization
QEMU supports userspace API virtualization for Linux and BSD kernel interfaces. This allows binaries compiled for one architecture's ABI (e.g., Linux PPC64) to run on a host with a different architecture ABI. This process involves CPU and syscall emulation without the need for hardware emulation.

### Flexible Integration
QEMU is designed to cater to diverse usage scenarios:
- **Direct Invocation**: Users can run QEMU with full control over its configuration and settings.
- **Integration with Management Layers**: QEMU offers a stable command-line interface and monitor API, enabling seamless integration into higher-level tools and platforms. It is commonly used in conjunction with libvirt for applications like oVirt, OpenStack, and virt-manager.

### Documentation
Documentation can be found hosted online at https://www.qemu.org/documentation/.

### Building

QEMU is multi-platform software intended to be buildable on all modern
Linux platforms, OS-X, Win32 (via the Mingw64 toolchain) and a variety
of other UNIX targets. The simple steps to build QEMU are:

```shell
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ../configure
  make
```

### Adding NXP S32K3X8EVB board

To add support for NXP S32K3X8EVB board in QEMU, you need to define a new System-on-Chip (SoC) model. This involves the following steps:

Create the SoC Model:

Write a new source file in the hw/arm directory (hw/arm/nxps32k358_soc.c).

Define the peripherals, memory map, and CPU for your SoC.

Define the Board:

Implement the board model in the hw/arm/ directory (hw/arm/nxps32k3x8evb.c).

Connect the SoC model to the board, specifying how peripherals are mapped and initialized.

Update Build System and KConfig:

Add your new files to the appropriate meson.build and KConfig files to ensure they are compiled.
