# QEMU: Open Source Emulator and Virtualizer

QEMU is a powerful and open source emulator and virtualizer designed to meet a wide range of use cases. By leveraging dynamic translation, it delivers high performance and flexibility for emulating complete systems or specific userspace environments.

## Key Features

### Full Machine Emulation
QEMU can emulate an entire machine in software without requiring hardware virtualization support. This enables running operating systems and applications designed for one hardware architecture (e.g., ARMv7) on a completely different architecture (e.g., x86_64). When integrated with Xen or KVM hypervisors, QEMU achieves near-native performance for CPUs, as the hypervisor manages the CPU while QEMU handles emulated hardware.

### Userspace API Virtualization
QEMU supports userspace API virtualization for Linux and BSD kernel interfaces. This allows binaries compiled for one architecture's ABI (e.g., Linux PPC64) to run on a host with a different architecture ABI (e.g., Linux x86_64). This process involves CPU and syscall emulation without the need for hardware emulation.

### Flexible Integration
QEMU is designed to cater to diverse usage scenarios:
- **Direct Invocation**: Users can run QEMU with full control over its configuration and settings.
- **Integration with Management Layers**: QEMU offers a stable command-line interface and monitor API, enabling seamless integration into higher-level tools and platforms. It is commonly used in conjunction with libvirt for applications like oVirt, OpenStack, and virt-manager.

### Building

QEMU is multi-platform software intended to be buildable on all modern
Linux platforms, OS-X, Win32 (via the Mingw64 toolchain) and a variety
of other UNIX targets. The simple steps to build QEMU are:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
